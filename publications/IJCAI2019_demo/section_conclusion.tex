In the future, we plan to implement many examples. We plan to extend our implementation to Algebraic decision diagrams (ADD) \cite{DBLP:journals/fmsd/BaharFGHMPS97} in order to add examples in robotics that need numerical values, not only Boolean values.

We also aim to study counting and sampling specific techniques (see for instance \citet{DBLP:conf/aaai/MeelVCFSFIM16}) for generating possible worlds, in order to tackle even bigger examples.
