In the future, we plan to implement many examples. We plan to extend our implementation to Algebraic decision diagrams (ADD) \cite{DBLP:journals/fmsd/BaharFGHMPS97} in order to tackle examples with numerical values, and not only Boolean values.

We aim at studying the use of counting and sampling specific techniques (see for instance \cite{DBLP:conf/aaai/MeelVCFSFIM16}) for generating possible worlds.
